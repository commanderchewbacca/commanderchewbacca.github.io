		<h1 >About Me </h1>
		<p>Hello! I am Steven Tsay, a sophomore Computer Science intended at UC Berkeley. Originally, I entered Berkeley with the intention of majoring in Political Science and going into law, but upon trying CS61A I discovered that Computer Science combines all of the positives that I enjoy from all of my other interests/hobbies: It is logical, yet flexible, like Political Science, it requires constant innovation and is mentally engaging like art, and most importantly, it is extremely influential in its ability  to drastically improve and shape our daily lives.</p>
		<p>Of course, completely switching my major to something I have no prior experiences in is extreme. Not only do I have to tackle something I have never done before and
still perform better than engineering students in order to declare, but I also have to catch up on the calculus I missed in high school. It is also extremely difficult to join technology groups while trying to catch up, making the past year very stressful, painful, yet ultimately very fulfilling.</p>
<p>I have been trying to improve myself, picking up CSS and HTML again, this semester I am excited to be learning some backend development languages/frameworks like Django and Node.JS. As well as requirements from other tech clubs.
Outside of school and academics, I really enjoy watching TV shows, playing video games( League of Legends and Overwatch), and playing Tennis. I also try to hit the gym because I want an amazing body, but that is going that well, but hopefully we will get there.</p>
<p>I am born and raised in Taiwan, every winter/summer break I fly back to replenish myself with amazing and cheap(amazingly cheap) street food. I left my doggo( a black poodle), there and he is one of the main motivators for me to return as much as possible.</p>
<p>One last major thing about me is that I am a huge Star Wars fan ever since elementary when I first watch the Phantom Menace. Star Wars have shaped my imagination as a child and most of my doodle contains “Benze soldiers”(clone troopers). Unfortunately, I did not realize that Berkeley generates my email by my Cal ID, and putting down commandechewbacca is anything but professional...
